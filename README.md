## Hi there 👋, this is Natalie

**I’m a software engineering student at 42 Paris who:**  

👉 Enjoys poking around with low-level languages  
☀️ Works on light-themed IDEs during the day  
🕸️ Despises try/catch with a disproportionate level of passion  


Currently tinkering with **DevOps** tools - Docker, Ansible, Kubernetes, etc.
